      <p>The political motive behind a detention is determined by the circumstances: it can involve arresting someone at a political event, detaining a political activist during campaigning or poster distribution, or an unwarranted arrest of a person known for their political or social activism. Here, 'politics' is broadly understood as advocating for one's rights and interests — events related to environmentalism, LGBTQ rights, urban development, or social demands are considered political by OVD-Info
      </p>
        <em>"Under the term 'action,' we refer to public events, primarily street protests like rallies, marches, and pickets. Public lectures, festivals, performances, and concerts are also considered actions, even if they are not street-based. Finally, political agitation, such as distributing leaflets on the streets or posting posters in the metro, is also regarded as an action for our dataset*,"</em> said Maria Chashilovaб – a lawyer and human rights activist from Moscow.
